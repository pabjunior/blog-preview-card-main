## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on structuring semantic HTML and organizing CSS for better readability and maintainability. Here are some highlights:

- Grouped related elements (e.g., `<img>`, `<span>`, `<small>`) inside `<div>` containers for better structure and styling.
- Used descriptive class names like `card-header`, `card-content`, `wrapper`, `card-title`, and `card-description` to improve code readability.
- Improved accessibility by adding meaningful `alt` attributes to images, such as:
  ```html
  <img
    class="card-image"
    src="assets/images/illustration-article.svg"
    alt="Illustration representing an article"
  />
  ```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Exploring advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid, for more complex layouts.
- Improving responsiveness to ensure designs look great on a wider range of devices and screen sizes.
- Experimenting with animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

- [A More Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This resource helped me understand and implement a modern CSS reset, ensuring consistent styling across different browsers. I found it particularly useful for improving the base styles of my project.
